I am an incoming Assistant Professor in [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu) at [The University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu) starting Fall 2024. My research focuses on the security and safety of AI-enabled systems, aiming to empower system providers and individual users to counteract attacks and biases. I am broadly interested in a range of topics in Security and Privacy relating to machine learning, including backdoor threats, adversarial generative AI, and machine learning for security. My projects are consistently published in conferences such as IEEE S&P / USENIX Security / CCS / NDSS, NeurIPS / ICML / ICLR, CVPR / ECCV / ACL, and ICSE / FSE. I am a recipient of [Maurice H. Halstead Memorial Award](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/news/articles/2023/2023_purdue_cs_awards.html) (for exemplary contributions to software engineering research), [ECCV AROW Workshop Best Paper Award](https://eccv22-arow.github.io) (2022), and [OOPSLA Distinguished Paper Award](https://2019.splashcon.org/attending/splash-awards#oopsla-2019-distinguished-paper-awards) (2019).

I obtained my Ph.D. from Purdue University under the supervision of [Xiangyu Zhang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/xyzhang/). I received my bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University.
